# Streat-Of-Nabara
 Game made for a gamejam. https://itch.io/jam/ponto-e-vrgula-game-jam



Streat Of Nabara is a 2D beat 'em up that I and four other friends made in a week without any experience in games of this genre. In this project I learned how to make a combo system, enemy artificial intelligence and special abilities. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish the project in time for the end of the jam and ended up without a worthy ending. Made in Godot
